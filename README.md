# YAKB: Yet Another Kanban Board
YAKB is a user-friendly Kanban Board WebApp based on the [drag-drop module](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) from Angular Materials. The backend is powered by [Fast-API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), utilizing a SQLite database to store your data.

## Purpose and Evolution

Originally, this project was conceived as a personal learning endeavor to gain familiarity with the basic mechanics of the Angular framework. However, as time went on, it evolved into a robust Kanban Board with additional features that set it apart from other apps in this category. Notably, YAKB includes a progress bar, providing a visual representation of your task completion status. Furthermore, it offers direct access to the underlying database, empowering users to derive insightful statistics based on the content and timestamps related to card creation and assignment.
